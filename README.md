We have identified that you currently have one or more Redshift single-node clusters that have a maintenance window scheduled at 00:00 UTC on Sundays. In order to improve our service resiliency and availability we plan to move any cluster that has this maintenance window to a start time within an 8 hour window on Sundays starting on February 15, 2023.                                                  |
